To further enhance the security of the Amaze File Manager, particularly around root access and ensuring stronger authentication, a couple of critical changes need to be made. This includes enforcing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) before granting root access and securing encryption practices, cloud service interactions, and APK integrity.

Below is the updated Python code for Amaze File Manager with 2FA for root access, AES encryption improvements, activity logging, and APK integrity verification:

bcrypt for secure password hashing

cryptography for symmetric encryption

pyotp for Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)

getpass for secure password input

requests for sending data (optional, for external services)

logging for security auditing

Key Features:

1. Password Hashing: Secure password storage using bcrypt.


2. Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data using symmetric encryption (Fernet).


3. 2FA: Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for extra layer of authentication.


4. Secure Password Input: Using getpass to ensure passwords are not visible when typed.

Explanation:

1. Password Hashing and Verification:

Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for secure storage. hash_password hashes the password, and verify_password compares the entered password with the stored hash.


2. Encryption and Decryption:

Sensitive data, such as the username, is encrypted using the cryptography.Fernet module. The encryption key is stored in a file (secret.key), which must be kept secure.

encrypt_data encrypts data, and decrypt_data decrypts it.


3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):

A time-based one-time password (TOTP) is generated and verified using the pyotp library. During authentication, the user is asked to input the TOTP generated by their 2FA app (e.g., Google Authenticator).


4. Secure User Setup and Authentication:

The setup_user function handles the user registration process, including password hashing and 2FA setup. The user’s encrypted username, hashed password, and 2FA secret are saved in a JSON file.

The authenticate_user function is used to verify the user’s credentials and 2FA code during login.


5. Logging:

The program logs key actions (user setup, login attempts, etc.) for auditing purposes, which can help track potential security breaches.


How it Works:

1. User Setup:

The user is prompted to enter a username and password. The password is hashed, and a 2FA secret is generated. The data is encrypted and stored securely in a JSON file.



2. Authentication:

When the user logs in, they provide their username, password, and 2FA code. The password is verified using bcrypt, and the 2FA code is verified using TOTP.




Considerations:

Key Management: The secret.key file must be stored securely. If an attacker gains access to it, they can decrypt data.

2FA: It’s important to ensure the user’s 2FA method is set up correctly and that they are using a secure method to generate OTPs (e.g., using an authenticator app).

Encryption: In this example, we encrypt user data like the username to prevent unauthorized access, but you could also encrypt sensitive information like email addresses or personal details.


This approach ensures that even if the attacker compromises a user’s password, they would still need the 2FA code to access the system, significantly enhancing device security.

Key Security Enhancements Implemented:

1. Root Access Security with 2FA:

Password Authentication: The first layer checks the root password.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Uses TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) for additional security, ensuring that even if the password is compromised, an attacker cannot gain root access without the OTP.


To enable 2FA, the code uses the pyotp library (which implements TOTP), and each user should have a unique TOTP secret securely stored.


2. AES Encryption & Key Management:

Files are encrypted and decrypted using Fernet encryption for strong symmetric encryption.

The encryption keys are generated securely and saved separately from the app's source code.
