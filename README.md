To develop a more secure version of a Python script related to file management, with an emphasis on protecting sensitive data and ensuring safe operations, we can start by identifying core functionalities related to file encryption, root access, and cloud storage interactions, which could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.

I'll illustrate how you can improve security by applying best practices for encryption, authentication, logging, and ensuring app integrity. This code will be more secure, focusing on data protection against malicious actors while preventing unauthorized access, and handling data securely both at rest and during operations.

Below is a Python script that simulates a file management operation, emphasizing security:

Explanation of Improvements:

1. Encryption:

The Fernet module is used for AES encryption, which is a modern, secure encryption standard.

Encryption keys are generated dynamically and saved securely, instead of hardcoding keys, reducing the risk of key leakage.

The code includes secure file encryption and decryption methods, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected.


2. File Integrity:

The verify_integrity function generates a hash (SHA-256) of the file to ensure its integrity. This can be used to check if files have been tampered with before and after any operation.


3. Logging & Auditing:

Comprehensive logging of file operations (such as encryption, cut/copy/delete, and cloud uploads) helps track all actions, making it easy to detect any suspicious activity.

Log entries are stored in a file (file_manager.log), and the script records critical events like authentication and encryption, providing an audit trail.


4. Root & Cloud Security:

Simulates OAuth-based authentication for uploading files to cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive), improving security with token-based authentication.

The authenticate_user function securely handles user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive features.


5. Authentication and Access Control:

The script requires secure user authentication via a master password (replace with actual secure methods, such as hashing or two-factor authentication).

It uses logging to monitor user authentication events for transparency.

Conclusion:

This Python script provides an example of securing file management operations with proper encryption, logging, and user authentication. The code demonstrates how to mitigate common security vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access, data tampering, and weak encryption. This approach makes it more resistant to malicious intrusions and data breaches.
